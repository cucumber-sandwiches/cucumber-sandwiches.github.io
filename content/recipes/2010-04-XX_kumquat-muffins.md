I usually make muffins using butter milk. I did not have any and wanted to make muffins so I tried using cream cheese instead. It worked very well.

I think one could easily replace the kumquats with any other type of fruit or leave them out altogether.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup margarine
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla sugar
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 100 g cream cheese
- 150 g kumquat

## Directions

1. Chop the kumquats including peel, I used a food processor to do this.
2. Whisk together the margarine and sugar until smooth. Add the eggs one by one, whisking each time until you can't see any trace of egg.
3. Preheat the oven to 180&#176;C
4. Whisk in the cream cheese and kumquat.
5. Mix the flour, baking powder, vanilla sugar. Add the flour mixture to the cream cheese mixture slowly.
6. Either line the muffin cups with paper liners or butter you muffin cups well. The batter should make about 12 muffins. I fill the muffin cups until they are 3/4 full.
7. Place the muffins in the oven for 18-20 minutes.
