## Ingredients

- 250 ml milk
- 1 tsp sugar
- 10 g fresh yeast
- 3 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 tbsp margarine
- rosemary
- sea salt

## Directions

1. Mix the milk, yeast and sugar in small bowl and leave for about 30 minutes.
2. Mix the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the yeast-mixture and stir well. Add the oil and knead the dough until it is smooth and does not stick to your hands anymore.
3. Butter a spring form (26 cm diameter). Alternatively one can use a large cast iron pan.
4. Divide the dough into 7 pieces and place into the spring form. Leave to rise for about 1 hour. I left mine to rise about 3 hours and it rose so much that one could no longer distinguish the individual rolls, as you can see in the pictures.
5. Preheat the oven to 200&#176;C.
6. Melt the margarine in a small bowl.
7. Carefully spoon the margarine over the rolls. Sprinkle with rosemary and sea salt.
8. Place into the oven for about 12 minutes until they are nice and brown.
9. Om nom nom.
