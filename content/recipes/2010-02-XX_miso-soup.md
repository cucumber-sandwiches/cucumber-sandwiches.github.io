## Ingredients

- 400 ml water
- 1 tsp. dashi-no-moto (powder)
- 1 shiitake mushroom
- 2 tbsp. miso paste (we used dark miso paste)
- 275 g silken tofu
- 2 scallions

## Directions

1. Drain the tofu, then cut it into small pieces.
2. Cut the shiitake in small pieces, place into a pot with 400 ml cold water and the dashi-no-moto and bring to a boil.
3. When the water in the pot is boiling turn down the heat. Then mix the miso paste with 6 teaspoons of the hot water in a small cup.
4. Add the miso and tofu to the pot. Turn up the heat again.
5. Cut the scallions into small rings.
6. When the soup is boiling again, add the scallions and take the pot off the heat.

As you can see on the picture, using this much tofu and scallion results in a very "full" soup. We think it would be better to use half the tofu and only one scallion.

The soup was very tasty, but we were full after eating it and didn't have much room left for the yummy sushi we wanted to eat afterwards. :(
