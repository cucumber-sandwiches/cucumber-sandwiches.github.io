## Ingredients

- 1 garlic clove
- 4-5 scallions (we only used the white parts)
- oil
- 250 g pasta (e.g. Penne)
- 125 ml whipping cream
- 125 ml milk
- 150 g Gorgonzola
- 2 tomatoes
- salt, pepper, oregano
- fresh basil
- a little grated Parmesan

## Directions

1. Chop the scallions and garlic. Heat oil in a pan to medium heat. Add the garlic and the whites of the scallions. Fry for 1-2 minutes.
2. Pour milk and whipped cream into the pan. Let it heat up while you chop the Gorgonzola coarsely. Add the Gorgonzola.
3. Bring water for the pasta to boil and cook according to the instructions on the package. For us it was 8-10 minutes.
4. To peel the tomatoes, we placed them in boiling water for a 1-2 minutes ("scalded" them). This makes the peel easy to remove (e.g. with a knife or your fingers). Chop the peeled tomatoes into small cubes and put them in the pan.
5. Turn the heat down. (The tomatoes should only get warm, not cooked mushy)
6. Add spices to taste! (salt, pepper, oregano)
7. Add pasta to sauce, stir.
8. Serve with freshly chopped basil and Parmesan on top.

As you can see below, the Gorgonzola sauce was quite tasty. :D
