## Ingredients

- 500 g broccoli
- 250 g ricotta
- 1-2 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp cumin
- 100 g grated cheese (Gouda)
- 1 egg
- 6 tortillas
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. pepper

## Directions

1. Cut the broccoli into small pieces. We cooked the broccoli for 3-4 minutes, but this is probably not necessary.
2. In a large bowl mix the broccoli, ricotta, cumin, garlic and 50 g of the cheese.
3. Stir in the egg and the salt and pepper.
4. Preheat the oven to 200 &#176;C.
5. Fill the tortillas with the broccoli mixture and wrap up tightly. Place them into a casserole dish.
6. Sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top.
7. Place into the oven and bake for about 30 minutes.

This tastes good together with a tomato salad.
