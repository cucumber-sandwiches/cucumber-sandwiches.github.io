For this bread, you have to start the day before you want to bake it. On that day, it only needs a few minutes. On the next day, it takes about 20 min to prepare and 45min to bake.

## Ingredients

- 200g oat flakes
- 400ml buttermilk
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 250-300g flour

## Directions

- Soak the oat flakes in the buttermilk. Leave in the fridge <i>over night</i>.
- The next morning, preheat the oven to 180&#176;C. If you have a fan oven, do not preheat and use 160&#176;C to bake later.
- Mix the baking powder, the salt and 250g of flour in a large bowl.
- Add the oat-flake-buttermilk mixture to the bowl. Knead until smooth.
- The dough should stop sticking to your hands after some kneading. If it doesn't, add more flour until it does.
- Form two loaves from the dough.
- Place them on a tray with baking paper and put it the oven (middle rack) for about 45min.
- Tap it with a wooden implement (e.g. a spoon) to see if it's done. It should sound hollow. You may have to bake it up to 10min more.

This bread is really tasty, even our cat likes it.
