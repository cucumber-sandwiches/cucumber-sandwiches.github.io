We found this delicious recipe for a salad: [Avocado Wasabi Salad](http://veganyumyum.com/2010/01/avocado-wasabi-salad/).

We didn't have any broccoli the first time we made it, but it was still great. The amount of dressing is a bit much and we still have some in the fridge, so next time we're probably only going to make half the dressing.
