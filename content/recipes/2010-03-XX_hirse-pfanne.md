We made this german recipe: [Hirse-Pfanne](http://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/289983274274/Hirsepfanne-mit-Joghurtsosse.html).</a>

I didn't add the whipped cream to the yoghurt and it was very good that way too.

It seems that 'Hirse' translates to millet, but I couldn't find very many english recipes with millet. Can you buy millet in England or another english-speaking country?
