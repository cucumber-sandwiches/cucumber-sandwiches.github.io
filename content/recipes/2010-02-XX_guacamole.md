## Ingredients

- 2 avocado (very ripe!)
- 6 tbsp. lime juice
- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 onion
- salt & pepper
- chili powder
- 1 tomato

## Directions

1. Peel the avocado. Place in a blender with 3 tbsp. lime juice and 1 tbsp. olive oil.
2. Chop the garlic and onion. Also place in the blender.
3. Add spices to taste. (salt, pepper, chili)
4. Blend!
5. Chop the tomato. Place in the blender.
6. Blend again briefly. (the tomato should remain chunky)
7. Enjoy!

Be careful with the chili. Guacamole tends to be a lot hotter if you eat it the next day. If you have the patience, leave the guacamole to sit a few hours before serving. (We never do this, because we don't)

It is best served as a dip for tortilla chips, although on the picture above it is shown on [scrambled tofu](scrambled-tofu).
