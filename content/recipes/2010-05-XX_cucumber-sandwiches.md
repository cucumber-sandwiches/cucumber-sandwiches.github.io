2. Add the milk to the yeast mixture.
3. In a large bowl mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, starch and butter. Add the yeast mixture and knead well. The dough is somewhat sticky and very soft.
4. Place the dough in a [bread pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_pan) and leave to rise for 2-3 hours.
5. Preheat the oven to 200 &#176;C.
6. Place toast onto the middle rack and bake for 35-40 minutes. The toast should sound hollow when tapped with a wooden implement.
