## Ingredients

- 50 g Butter
- 10 g fresh yeast (or a packet dried yeast)
- 250 g flour
- 90 ml water
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp sugar

- 250 g frozen, chopped spinach
- 100 g feta
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp. creme fraiche
- salt
- pepper

## Directions

1. Defrost the spinach.

Add the butter and knead well. It should give a nice soft dough, which does not stick to your fingers, if it does add more flour.
3. Leave the dough to rise for an hour in a warm place.
4. Chop the cloves finely.
5. Mix the spinach, the cloves, the creme fraiche, feta and salt and pepper to taste in another bowl.
6. When the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 200&#176;C.
7. Roll out the dough to about 0.5 cm thickness. Using for example a large glass of approximately 10 cm diameter cut the dough into round pieces.
8. Place about a tbsp. of the spinach-mixture onto every round piece. Fold together and use a fork to press the edges firmly together.
9. Put on a baking sheet and bake in the middle of the oven for about 20 minutes.
