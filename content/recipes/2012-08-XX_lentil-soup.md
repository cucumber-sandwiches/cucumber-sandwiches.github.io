## Ingredients

- oil
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 2 cm ginger
- 6 cardamom pods
- 1 tsp. yellow curry paste
- 300 g lentils
- 500 ml vegetable broth
- 400 ml coconut milk

## Directions

1. Heat oil in pan.
2. Cut garlic &amp; ginger into small pieces.
3. Saute ginger, garlic, and cardamom pods in the pan for 2 minutes.
4. Add curry paste &amp; lentils and fry briefly.
5. Pour in the vegetable broth and coconut milk.
6. Let it simmer until the lentils are done (see package).

As you can see in the picture, we also added some leek, carrots, and potato. Basically, every kind of vegetable can be added. For example, spring onions are very nice.

As for the type of lentils, we usually use half slow-cooking green lentils and half faster-cooking red lentils. This way the red lentils dissolve slightly, giving a nice texture to the soup.
