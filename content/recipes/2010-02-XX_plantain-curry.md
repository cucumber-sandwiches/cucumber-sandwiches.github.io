## Ingredients

- 2 plantains
- oil
- 3-4 scallions
- 1 yellow (bell) pepper
- 1 tbls. curry paste (yellow)
- 400 ml coconut milk
- 1 tbls. sugar
- 1 tbls. vinegar
- 4 tbls. fish sauce or veg alternative such as lupin sauce or plum sauce
- 3 cm ginger
- 1 tsp. coriander green
- lemon grass

- 1 cup rice as side dish

## Directions

1. Peel the plantains. One way to do this is to slice into the peel lengthwise with a knife. Then the peel can be stripped off somewhat more easily. Then dice the plantain into ~1 cm thick cubes.
2. Heat the oil in a wok. Fry the plantains about 4-5 minutes.
3. Cut the scallions into small rings and the bell peppers into small pieces. Chop the ginger finely.
4. Add the white parts of the scallions to the wok and fry for about a minute.
5. Add the curry paste, the coconut milk, sugar, vinegar, fish sauce and ginger. Stir. Leave to simmer for 10-12 minutes.
6. In the meantime, you can prepare the rice.
7. Add the peppers and leave for another 2-3 minutes. The Curry is done when the plantain is soft, but not dissolved.
8. Remove from the heat.
9. Add the coriander green, the lemon grass and green parts of the scallions. Stir briefly and serve with rice.

Plantains are cooking banananas (like Nanny Ogg we know how to spell banana, we just don't know how to stop) and we got ours from a local Asian super market.

They taste like banana but have the consistency (and cooking properties) of a potato. The curry can also be prepared with potatoes instead of plantains. In this case, use about 4-5 potatoes.
