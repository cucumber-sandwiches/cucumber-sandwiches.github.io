## Ingredients

- 250 ml water
- 10 g fresh yeast (or 1 packet dried yeast)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp. salt
- 450 g flour
- 20 g butter
- 1 tbsp yoghurt (optional)
- 1 egg
- 3 tbsp. milk

## Directions

1. Crumble the yeast into the water and mix until dissolved. Add the sugar and salt. Leave it for at least half an hour in a warm place.
2. Place flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter, yoghurt and yeast-mixture. Knead until you get a soft dough. It should not stick to your fingers, if it does add more flour. If the dough is very hard and not pliable add some more water.
3. Leave dough to rise for about 20 minutes.
4. Shape the rolls and place on a baking sheet. I used these [instructions](http://www.preparedpantry.com/howtomakekaiserrolls.htm)</a>. Of course any other shape also works.
5. Leave the rolls to rise for at least another 20 minutes, but no longer than an hour.
6. Mix the egg and the milk and carefully glaze the rolls. This gives a nice brown crust.
7. Preheat the oven to 250&#176;C and place a small bowl with water in the oven, so that there is some steam in the oven while baking.
8. Place the rolls in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes.
9. Turn down the heat to 200&#176;C and let the steam out of the oven. Bake for another 10 minutes. When tapped with a wooden implement the rolls should sound hollow.
