## Ingredients

- 120 g margarine<
- 100 g sugar
- 2 eggs (large)
- 180 g flour
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 6 tbsp. espresso
- 150 g chocolate

## Directions

1. Chop 50 g of the chocolate into small pieces.
2. Place margarine and sugar in a large bowl. Mix until fluffy. Add the eggs one by one, beating the mixture until it is smooth each time.
3. Preheat the oven to 180&#176; C.
4. Mix the flour and baking powder and stir into the bowl. Add the espresso and chopped chocolate and stir once more. The batter is now done.
5. Take three cappuccino cups and smear a bit of margarine into them. Add batter until 2/3 full and press a third of the remaining chocolate in each one.
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes and serve warm.

This recipe can be made in any cups as long as they can be placed in the oven. If smaller cups are used, the cakes will be finished sooner. For example, if the batter fits into 5-6 cups, they would need about 15-18 minutes.

The Cup-O'-Ccino is a type of cupcake (seen in the front of the picture) and not - in fact - an owl.
