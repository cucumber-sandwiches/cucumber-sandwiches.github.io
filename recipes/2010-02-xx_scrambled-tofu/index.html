Directions Go to http://www.theppk.com/recipes/dbrecipes/index.php?RecipeID=110 and do what it says. :D The only things we did differently were that we left out the mushrooms and the nutritional yeast (where can you get this stuff?). It was yummy none the less!
Especially the tummy-rubbing part was easy, because the amount was more than enough for the two of us and we were full for the rest of the day.
As the only side dish, we made some Guacamole
